If you have installed old b2 autocomplete for bash remove it now:
```sh
    rm `$HOME/.bash_completion.d/b2`
```

Install bash completion by running:
```sh
    activate-global-python-argcomplete
```

For support of other shells see https://pypi.org/project/argcomplete/#activating-global-completion .
